lists are similier to vectors as in you can have multiple elements of the same type and
it can dynamically grow in size

the two big differences between a vector and a list
1. you can remove elementrs from the both the beginning and the end while vectors are optimized for changes at the end
2. unlike a vectors a list does not support random access meaning you cannot directly jump to a specific index or access
   elements by index numbers

there usefull for just holding data and adding/removing elements at any point
