a vector is  basically a resizable array it stores multiple elements of the
same datatype the key difference between a array and a vector is arrays cannot
be changed but in vectors you can remove and add elements to it and vectors 
also have many usefull built in functions to modify it easily

vectors are usefull for storing data that isent permanent and will have things added and removed
from it
